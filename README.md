Designed and implemented a Hospital Management System (HMS) using essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and heaps. The system should manage various hospital functions such as patient records, doctor schedules, and appointment queues. 

​Optimize​ - Hospital Operations, Streamline management of patient records, doctor schedules, and appointment systems.​

Implement ​-  Key Data Structures: Demonstrate practical applications of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and heaps in a real-world scenario.​

Enhance​ - Data Efficiency and Accessibility, and minimize time complexity for data retrieval, insertion, and updates to ensure smooth hospital workflows.​

Develop​ - A Scalable and Robust System. Design a framework capable of managing increasing data loads while maintaining reliability and performance.​
